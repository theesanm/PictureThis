Image Generation Platform Development Plan - Picture This(Need a catchy name)
Project Overview
This plan outlines the development of a web application that allows users to generate images using LLM-based AI models, with a credit-based purchasing system. The platform will include user authentication, credit management, image generation, and storage capabilities.


1. Project Scope
Core Features
User registration and authentication
Credit purchase system ($1 = 100 credits)
Image generation interface (prompt + optional image upload)
Image storage and download functionality
Credit tracking and usage management
Administrative interface for cost configuration and reporting

Technical Requirements
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with optional React or Vue.js)
Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django/Flask)
Database: PostgreSQL
Image Storage: PostgreSQL (bytea) + filesystem backup
Authentication: JWT or session-based
Payment Processing: Integration with payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
Image Generation: API integration with LLM-based image generator (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
